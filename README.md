# Todo-postman
This Postman project is focused on testing the registration and login functionality of the 'todo' application. It includes testing API endpoints for both valid and invalid registration and login scenarios. The project aims to ensure that users can successfully register and log in with valid credentials, while also verifying that the system handles invalid data (such as incorrect email, password, or missing fields) appropriately by returning the correct error messages and status codes. The goal is to validate the application's user authentication flow and ensure that it behaves correctly under different input conditions
